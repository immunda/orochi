Worked to provide a standardised interface for cloud infrastructure monitoring, to overcome the problems of monitoring disparate network devices (routers, virtualisation hosts, etc.), through various protocols (IMPI, SNMP, custom agent) in multiple locations (public Internet, private network segments, etc.). Created a distributed network of data collection agents to be placed on the Internet or behind private networks, reporting to distributed collectors over a gossip protocol developed on top of XMPP to offer high availability.
